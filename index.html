        <h2>Why Spiderman Is My Fav</h2>
        <p>Spiderman is my favorite Marvel superhero because I don't know of any other Marvel superheroes. He is pretty famous so I thought he was a good choice. I'm sure I would like some of the other Marvel superheroes, though.</p>
        <p>Spiderman is pretty cool because he is like a modern-day tarzan, swinging building to building in the concrete jungle. But, if I'm being honest, spiderman isn't my favorite superhero. It is actually Batman. But since this was was an assignment about Marvel superheroes I couldn't pick him.</p>
